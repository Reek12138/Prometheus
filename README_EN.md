# Prometheus - Open Source Autonomous Drone Project

In Greek mythology, **Prometheus** is one of the most intelligent gods. We hope this project can bring unlimited wisdom and light to R&D in drones.

## Project Overview

Prometheus is an open source **autonomous drone software platform**, which provides **full set of solutions** for the intelligent and autonomous flight of drones. This project is based on the [PX4](https://docs.px4.io/main/zh/index.html) open source flight controller firmware, and aims to provide PX4 developers with mature and available **airborne computer terminal** programs, bringing a more concise and faster development experience. At present, modules such as **control** ,**planning**, and **target detection** have been integrated, and simulation code of Gazebo is also provided.

  - This project relies on [Amov Lab](https://www.amovlab.com) to operate
